# :snake: Monty Interpreter

Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This interpreter was built in the C language and is compliant with `ISO90`, `ISO99`, & `ISO11`. It reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably `.m` although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Our interpreter can be run as either a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). Mode can be switched mid-script. The interpreter can handle a variety of Monty opcodes, including printing, mathematical operations, and more - all handled opcodes are listed below.

## :running: Getting Started

* [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) - Operating system reqd.

* [GCC 4.8.4](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/) - Compiler used

## :arrow_down: Installing and Using

Clone the repository into a new directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Mostafaaa/monty.git
```
Compile with the following:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```

Run the interpreter on a file:

```
./monty file.m
```
## :wrench: Header file [monty.h](./monty.h)

### Data structures 
Use the following data structures, dont forget to include them in the header file.

```c
/**
 * struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)
 * @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)
 *
 * Description: doubly linked list node structure
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
 */
typedef struct stack_s
{
        int n;
        struct stack_s *prev;
        struct stack_s *next;
} stack_
```

```c

/**
 * struct instruction_s - opcode and its function
 * @opcode: the opcode
 * @f: function to handle the opcode
 *
 * Description: opcode and its function
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
 */
typedef struct instruction_s
{
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
} instruction_t;
```

## :wrench: Monty Opcodes

* **push**
  * Usage: `push <int>`
  * Pushes an element to the stack.
  * The parameter `<int>` must be an integer.

* **pall**
  * Prints all values in the stack/queue, starting from the top.

* **pint**
  * Prints the top value of the stack/queue.

* **pop**
  * Removes the top element of the stack/queue.

* **swap**
  * Swaps the top two elements of the stack/queue.

* **nop**
  * Does not do anything.

* **add**
  * Adds the top two elements of the stack/queue.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is popped.

* **sub**
  * Subtracts the top element of the stack/queue from the second element from the top.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **mul**
  * Multiplies the top two elements of the stack/queue.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **div**
  * Divides the second element from the top of the stack/queue by the top element.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **mod**
  * Computes the modulus of the second element from the top of the stack/queue divided by the top element.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **pchar**
  * Prints the character value of the top element of the stack/queue.
  * The integer at the top is treated as an ASCII value.

* **pstr**
  * Prints the string contained in the stack/queue.
  * Prints characters element by element until the stack/queue is empty, a value is `0`, or an error occurs.

* **rotl**
  * Rotates the top element of the stack/queue to the bottom.

* **rotr**
  * Rotates the bottom element of the stack/queue to the top.

* **stack**
  * Switches a queue to stack mode.

* **queue**
  * Switches a stack to queue mode.

:arrow_forward: Opcodes preceeded by a `#` are treated as comments and the corresponding line is ignored.

:arrow_forward: Lines can be empty and can contain any number of spaces before or after an opcode and its argument (only the first opcode and/or argument is taken into account).
